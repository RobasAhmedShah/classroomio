I started my open source journey in October of 2023 by working on [Formbricks](https://formbricks.com). It was the first time I got to really work on a project that was used by hundreds of people and at the same time the [code was public](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/commits?author=rotimi-best) for everyone to see.
