_Rotimi Best at the 2 day EduAI Hub Summit held at the University of Lagos_

I was invited by [EduAI Hub](https://eduaihub.org/) to their 2 day summit at the University of Lagos to talk about the progress we've made as a company and how we are using AI in education.

A bit about EduAI Hub before I jump into my experience at the summit:

> The EduAI hub is an African based research network on responsible artificial intelligence innovations that seek to advance education across Africa.
>
> The EduAI hub is located within the University of Lagos main campus. The Hub network presently comprises the University of Lagos, Université d’Abomey Calavi, in Benin Republic, and Data Science Nigeria (DSN).

### My experience

Now to my experience - **it was nothing less than amazing**.

I could see how the eyes of some of the educators lite up when I said we can allow them build a customisable alternative to Google Classroom without writing a single line of code. I spoke about the importance of a customisable no-code elearning platform that anyone could use to deploy their own learning management system that suits their brand. I also gave an analogy using Shopify and Wordpress, how Shopify is allowing businesses create ecommerce stores in minutes or Wordpress allowing writters and businesses create robust websites in minutes - that's exactly what we want to do in the educational space starting with bootcamps.
